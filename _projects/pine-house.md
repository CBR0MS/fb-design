### Integrating modern and classic

The addition and remodel of a traditional 1930's home in Kentfield, CA. The project consisted of a new kitchen, family room, entry, and mother-in-law unit for an extended family. The new elements were designed to blend into the original home and to bring a fresh look to the whole. 

This project also included landscape design; working with the many mature oaks on a sloping site to create a variety of seating and entertainment spaces around the home.
