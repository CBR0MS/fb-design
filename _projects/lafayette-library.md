The buildings of the Lafayette Library and Learning Center embrace the sloped topography of the site, defining a pedestrian street which extends the full length of the site and features a landscaped amphitheater, intimate reading areas, and outdoor cafe seating. The community building anchors the busy corner intersection and includes a large meeting area, platform, and art gallery.

### Interior 

The main library spaces are supported by wood paralam columns trusses. High clerestory glazing infuses the interior with natural light, and deep overhangs and sun shades provide protection from heat gain and glare.

### Exterior 

The building's exterior is clad with amber gold granite, reclaimed teak siding, and warm-toned metal panels. Photovoltaic panels above the surface parking lot contribute to offseting the building's electrical needs.
